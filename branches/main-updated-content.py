MAIN-UPDATED BRANCH - Reference Content
========================================

This file shows EXAMPLE content that would be added to the main-updated
branch to simulate "main getting updates while you work."

The actual main-updated branch contains simple, non-conflicting changes:
- CHANGELOG.md file
- Minor README updates (like adding a Contributors section)

These changes WON'T conflict with exercises/collaborative/exercise_9.py,
so students can practice clean rebasing.
